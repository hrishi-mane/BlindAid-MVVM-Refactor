    setting while frag is created that the frag has menu
    then just inflating by overriding onOptionMnenu is enough
    no need to mention it explicitly in toolbar since that is where the menu will be anyways if it is mention that frag will have menu if inflated
    just create a menu xml file to decide on design


    if want to create a custom toolbar for fragment
     first remove the existing actionbar from theme
     create a appbar and wihting that create a toolbar in xml
    getSystemToolbar access from within kotlin and then set it to your custom toolbar
